1. This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
	The number, followed by   
if the number is greater than 0: is positive  
if the number is 0: is zero  
if the number is less than 0: is negative  

2. This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed   
	 The string is, followed by   
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5  
if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0   
if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
